This is a custom distribution of Python, version 3.1.2.

This distribution includes a custom CMake-based build system tailored to fit in
the Athena Game Framework.

Since rewriting a full CMake-based build system for Python is a very time-consuming task,
the provided CMake scripts reuse the standard configure & make build system of Python.
